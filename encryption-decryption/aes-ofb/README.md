# aes-ofb example

`aes-ofb` is an example of
tbd._

I have the following AES mode examples,

* [aes](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes)
  No Mode
* [aes-gcm](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-gcm)
  Galois/Counter Mode
* [aes-cbc](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-cbc)
  Cipher Block Chaining
* [aes-cfb](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-cfb)
  Cipher Feedback Mode
* [aes-ctr](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-ctr)
  Counter Mode
* [aes-ofb](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-ofb)
  Output Feedback Mode **(You are here)**

## RUN

```go
run aes-ofb.go
```

You output should be,
