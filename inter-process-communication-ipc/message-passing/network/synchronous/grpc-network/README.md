## OVERVIEW

gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can
run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and
across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing,
tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable
in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile
clients and browsers to backend services.

## RUN

Run,

```bash
go run grpc-network.go
```

## TEST

To create _test files,

```bash
gotests -w -all grpc-network.go
```

To unit test the code,

```bash
go test -cover ./... 
```

## COMMUNICATION OVERVIEW

### SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATION

Synchronous and asynchronous communication really depends on
what you're referring too. For example, if you have a uni-directional
communication and you are referring to the data transfer. Or if it
a bi-directional communication and you're referring to
the reply.

Here is a high-level view,

* Synchronous – The client expects a timely response and might
  even block while it waits
* Asynchronous – The client doesn’t block while waiting for a response,
  and the response, if any, may not be immediate
