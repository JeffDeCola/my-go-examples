## OVERVIEW

Message queues are a form of asynchronous IPC. They are a
communication method that allows applications to send and receive
messages. The messages are stored in a queue until the receiving
application is ready to process them.

## RUN

Run,

```bash
go run main.go
```

## TEST

To create _test files,

```bash
gotests -w -all main.go
```

To unit test the code,

```bash
go test -cover ./...
```
