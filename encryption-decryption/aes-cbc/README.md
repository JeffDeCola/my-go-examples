  No Mode
* [aes-gcm](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-gcm)
  Galois/Counter Mode
* [aes-cbc](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-cbc)
  Cipher Block Chaining **(You are here)**
* [aes-cfb](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-cfb)
  Cipher Feedback Mode
* [aes-ctr](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-ctr)
