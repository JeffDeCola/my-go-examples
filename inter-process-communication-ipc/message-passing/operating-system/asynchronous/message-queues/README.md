## CLIENT/SERVER MODEL

Inter-process communication (IPC) message passing is based on the
client-server model as shown,

![IMAGE - client-server-request-and-reply-model.jpg - IMAGE](../../../../../docs/pics/inter-process-communication/client-server-request-and-reply-model.jpg)

* Synchronous – The client expects a timely response and might
  even block while it waits
* Asynchronous – The client doesn’t block while waiting for a response,
  and the response, if any, may not be immediate

## MESSAGE QUEUES OVERVIEW

Message queues are a form of asynchronous IPC. They are a
communication method that allows applications to send and receive
messages. The messages are stored in a queue until the receiving
application is ready to process them.

## RUN

Run,

```bash
go run message-queues.go
```

## TEST

To create _test files,

```bash
gotests -w -all message-queues.go
```

To unit test the code,

```bash
go test -cover ./... 
```
