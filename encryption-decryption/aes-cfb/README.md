I have the following AES examples,

* [aes](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes)
* [aes-gcm](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-gcm)
* [aes-cbc](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-cbc)
* [aes-cfb](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-cfb)
  (You are here)
* [aes-ctr](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-ctr)
* [aes-ofb](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/encryption-decryption/aes-ofb)
