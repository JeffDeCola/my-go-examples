## OVERVIEW

REST is a software architectural style that defines a set of
constraints to be used for creating Web services. RESTful Web services
allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual
representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set
of stateless operations. RESTful Web services are characterized by how
they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.

## RUN

Run,

```bash
go run main.go
```

## TEST

To create _test files,

```bash
gotests -w -all main.go
```

To unit test the code,

```bash
go test -cover ./...
```
